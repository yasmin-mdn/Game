### T-Rex Pro
![T-Rex Pro](https://github.com/yasmin-mdn/Game/blob/main/Trex%20Pro/Trex.png)
## What we had to do?
We had to develop this game for our game jam.<br />
Our game jam’s theme was “Classic Game Remix.” We had to choose a classic game we liked and add some features/mechanics. <br />
As Dinosaur T-Rex Game is a kind of nostalgia for me, I chose to add features to this game.<br />

features/mechanics: <br />
- [x] Run
- [x] Jump(space key)
- [x] Shooting Fire(F key)
- [x] Shoot Damage cactus not Rocks
- [x] Score Combo (Hearts)
- [x] Shooting Combo (yellow objects)
- [x] Show Score
- [x] Show Shooting state
- [x] Game Over
