## What we had to do?
We had to develop this game for our game jam.<br />
Our game jam’s theme was “Classic Game Remix.” We had to choose a classic game we liked and add some features/mechanics. <br />
As Dinosaur T-Rex Game is a kind of nostalgia for me, I chose to add features to this game.<br />
## How to play?
Download Myproject.exe from this path "My project/Hw/exe".<br />
Run the file and enjoy playing.<br />
You can Jump using the "Space key" and Shoot fireballs using the "F key".note that fireballs can damage cactuses, not rocks. You can collect an extra shooting combo by collecting yellow objects; collecting a scoring combo will increase your heart count! <br />
