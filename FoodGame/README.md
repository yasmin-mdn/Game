# Prototype 2 - Food Game

![Food Game](https://github.com/yasmin-mdn/Game/blob/main/FoodGame/FoodGame.png)
## What we had to do?
We had to develop this prototype for the game design course as a mini project.<br />
You must collect food; burgers will increase your heart count, and avoid eating fish bones!<br />
## How to play?
Download foodgameprj.exe from this path "FoodGame/HW/Export".<br />
Run the file and enjoy playing.<br />
You can move the plate using the A and D keys. <br />
