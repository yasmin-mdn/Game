# Prototype 1

![2D-PuzzleGame](https://github.com/yasmin-mdn/Game/blob/main/2D-PuzzleGame/2dgame.png)
## what we had to do?
We had to develop this prototype as a mini project for the game design course.<br />
It’s a simple 2d game. You must collect keys to open the purple door and win; yellow doors are teleport doors. Falling to the death zone means you lost the game. Note that you can’t jump when you are on the sticky platform.<br />
## How to play?
You can jump using space key, collect keys and teleport using the E key and move left and right using A and D . <br />
