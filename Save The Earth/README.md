# Save The Earth
The chief project of our game course was the final project, which was a group project. We had no specific theme or limitation on what game we should develop. However, the Teacherâ€™s assistants investigated our GDD(Game Design Document) to ensure the proposed idea involved enough challenges to deal with.<br />
My teammate in this project was talented [Amirali](https://github.com/AmiraliPak).

This game is in Arcade and Survival style.There is a 3D sphere as the Earth, in which the main character is placed in the middle and moves in different directions.
The planet has a certain amount of life, which is reduced by the impact of meteorites and the shooting of spaceships around the planet, and the game ends when the earth is destroyed. By getting a special power-up, the character can increase the life of the earth and prevent the collision of meteorites and destroy spaceships by firing fireballs.
