# Save The Earth
The chief project of our game course was the final project, which was a group project. We had no specific theme or limitation on what game we should develop. However, the Teacherâ€™s assistants investigated our GDD(Game Design Document) to ensure the proposed idea involved enough challenges to deal with.<br />
My teammate in this project was talented [Amirali](https://github.com/AmiraliPak).
